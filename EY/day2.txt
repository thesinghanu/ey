How   to get  user  input   from java  Program?
following are the  diff   way where     user  can read  i/p from key board
1) through  Scanner  class
2) through  io pkg   DataInputStream   class / BufferedReader class/ InputStreamReader class



through  Scanner  class
It is present in   java.util pkg

Constructor
Scanner(InputStream  is)
here   inputstream  is   keyboard(System.in)

methods
int  nextInt()   reads  integer
String next()    reads   String
String nextLine() reads  String  with  space
double  nextDouble()   reads    double 
float  nextFloat()   reads  float
e.t.c

Loops  supported   by java
control  statements
if   if else  if else ladder nested  if

loops
while   do  while   for   for each   nested   for   for   with  comma   for   with only condition

jump statements
break  continue  switch case


if
syntax

if(condition)
{
   statement;
}

if   else
syntax

if(condition)
{
   statement;
}
else
{
   statement;
}


nested if  
syntax


if(condition)
{
   statement;
if( condition)
{
    statement;
}
else
{

statement;

}
}
else
{
statement;
}
write  a  program  to read  a first  no
if  no==1   read  second  no if sencond no==2   display  both are correct
if  1 no is  correct  but  sencond no is wrong display   second no is incorrect
if  first  no is  wrong  display  INVALID

if else  ladder
it evaluates   any  boolean expression
compred  to swith case  it is  slow
 syntax
if(condition)
{
  statement;
}
esle  if(condtion)
{
statemet;
}
else
{
statement;
}


eneter the   month
if  month == 11 12 1 2   display  winter
if month== 3 4 5 6   display  summer
esle
display Spring


while
syntax
while(condition)
{
      Body
}
here  if the  condition is  not satisfied at  1st  time  only
then body of loop  will  Not  execute  even  on single  time


because in this  condition  is checked at   first 



do while
syntax
do
{
      body
}
while(condition);

here  if the  condition is  not satisfied at  1st  time  only
then body of loop  will    execute  atleast  one  time

because in this  condition  is checked at   LAST 

using while  loop  display  10  to 1  no   by   reading i/p  from keyboard



for   loop


synatx
for(initilaization;  condition; iteration)
{
  statement;
}
for(;condition;)
{}
display  1  to 10  no using    only   for  with condition



array
it  is  sequence  of  contiguous  elements  of  same data type
it is  static   it's   size  is fixed
u cannot change it's  size at  run time
it supports  index  based access
it supports   random  access

type   of  arrys
single  dimension array
multi dimension array


how  to create  an  array

Single Dimensional  array  
2 ways
instantiating and  declaring an array
int  a[]=new int[3];

initializing and  declaring an array
String[] a={"2","4","6"};


in java  array has  a property called length

for  each loop
it is  also  called  enhanced   for  loop
introduced  in jdk 1.5
syntax
for(datatype  varname :   array/list)
{
    statement;
}

multi  dimensional array
instantiating and  declaring an array
int  a[][]=new int[3][3];
here  1st  dimension  represents  rows 2nd represents column
initializing and  declaring an array
int a[][]={{22,11,44}, {88,33,66}, {1,5,3}}


Jump statements

switch case

syntax
switch(conditicon)
{
   case "" :  statement;break;
case "" :  statement;break;
case "" :  statement;break;
case "" :  statement;break;
default:statement;break;
}


}
1)  evaluates   boolean  expresssion based on case  values

2)very fast compared to if else ladder as it knows the  data  type of case value
creates  jump table  inside the  memory
3)  u can write  / nest  switch  within switch
4) if  u are  not using nested switch then  the  case values  must be different
5) break in each case  exits  from switch
6) case  data  type  must be  int  long byte  short   char  String


break

used to break out  from  the  loop

continue  breaks  out  from  current  iteration  but loop continues

display   odd  nos   between  1 to 20  using  continue

Java   does not supports  goto statements
But u can use  jump statements  like break continue as a goto statement

Syntax
break   aliasloopname;
continue aliasloopname;


1)write  a  program  to create a  Jagged array

0
1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14


2)  write  a program  to check  entered   no is  ARM STRONG OR  NOT


3)  WRITE  program  to generate   10 fibonessi nos

4) write  a  program  to sort  intergers  stored in array  in ascending order


Object Oriented Programming IN java
features of oops
methods  objects classes
method overloading
constructor
this  static  nested classes

inheritance  types
method overriding upcasting downcasting
super init blk  final abstract classes  interfaces   nested  interfaces
access specifiers  pkgs   


dividing  programs  into  different  methods  classes and  objects
is called  Object  orieneted programing
it helps to maintain the  program  if program/application grows large
in oops  global  data  cannot be accessed  from every where

class
it is a TEMPLATE  FOR  an Object
it is  blue print for an object
it is a container  for DATA and Code
top  level class must have only  public  / default  access specifiers


syntax

accessspecifier class classname
{
    instancevar;
   methods(){}
   blocks{}
constructors{}
}

public  class   Abc
{
    int k;//  instance var
   static  int k1=100;  // static  var
   void m()   // void method
{}
    int m1(){}// method  has return type
    {  System.out.println("Hi");}   init  block
  Abc(){}    // constructor
}

In the  above class
 instancevar;
   methods(){}
   blocks{}
constructors{}  are called

MEMBERS of the class


methods
these contains the business logic

specifies the  behaviiour if the  class / Object


2  types  
non  abstract method  :
method  which has  implementation/ body
it is also called  concrete  method
it has  again 2 types
1) method does not return  any thing
syntax
public  void  add(int a, int b)
{
   System.out.println(a+b);
}
such  methods  CANNOT be invoked in println statements

2) method  returns  something
syntax
public  int  add(int a, int b)
{

   return a+b;
}
such  methods  CAN be invoked in println statements
and  such methods  must   return  something by spcifying return key word





abstract  method
method  which has EMPTY body OR NO implementation


Object
It is a  real world  entity
it can be a name of a person thing or place
it is an instance of a  class

object  has   3 properties
state  represents  attributes of the objcet
eg if  laptop is an object  then it's name, price, brand  are called  state of object

behavoiur : represents the  functionality of the Object
if  mobile is an object then it's  behaviour  would be 
used for  speaking, calling  ,  browsing, e.t.c

id
when  object is created  java compiler  provides   one  reference id for each object
it is  fully qulified class name(pkgname.classname)  with hexadecimal value

how  to create object

using  new key word
using newInstance() of class Class
using  clone() method of Object  class
using  factory method(static  method)
using anonymous  object


using  new keyword
new keyword  allocates  the  memory  for object  in contigous  memory locations
it allocates  memory at  run time

Syntax
class Student
{
   int id;
}
Student  st;    //  st has  null
st=new Student()  // now st has  copy of Student class instance variables  like id 

above  2 steps  can be merged to
Student st=new Student();


now   st gets the copy of  instance variables of Student  class

u cann access members  of the  Student  class  using  Object  by dot(.)  operator


write a  program  to create a  Student class with id, name and city 
and  initialize and display
use  oops   concepts

in the  above program  id name and  city  goes into  heap area
id1 name1  city1  goes into   stack area
when insertStudent() method  invocation is over  these are eligible for  gc
simillarly  student  object also   stored in stack  area
as  it is local varaible 
it is also  eligible for  gc  when  main() method  invoked


Create  a class called Employee with id, name, des and salary
and  calculate  netsal by  following  formula
net=basicsal+da+hra-tax

where   da=150%basicsal
    hr=30%basicsal
   tax =1000



how  to create   anonymous object

Anonymous  objects  means  objects  created  with  out any name
Compiler  will  assigns  name  for  such  object at the  background
and   when  any methods are  invoked  from  such objects
then  after  invocation  of method completes  java  gc automatically
recollects  memory  for  such objects

such  object  creation  is  called   "object creation ON FLY"

to   access each the  members  of  a class
every time  u need  to  create  anonymous objcets
java  bean

It is a reusable  s/w  component  which can be  accessed  from any wahere
It contains  default constructors setter  methods  and  getter  methods

Setter methods  used  to set the  value
Getter  methods  used to get the values
these are used  for  accessing private  fields  from  out side of the Class

class Person
{
   int id;
String name;
  double salary;

   public  void  setId(int id1)
{
      id=id1;
}
   public   int   getId()
{
    return id;
}

write  program  to    create  a  Class called
Product  with id name  categgory and  price
and  display. Use  Setter and  GETTER methods

WAP to  implement  stack  program
create    4   menu  items
1)push2)pop3)display4)exit

use  methods   objcets and loops
