Nested  Interfaces
Like classes interfaces can also be nested

advantages
1) imporves  readability  code maiantainability  and  achieves code optimization
as  all  interfaces are  specified at same location
2)  nested interfaces also  helps you to access  the all the  contants of
outer interfaces also

nested  interfaces   must have  public or  default access specifiers
as  top   level interfaces  also have

we can  nest interface  within interface
we can nest  ineterface within class
we can nest class  within interface


another  type  of  non static  nested class  is  anonymous inner class

anonymous inner classes  means  classes are  created  wth out  name
such  classes  must be  defined  if  there is a class Hierarchy
compiler  will provides  name  for  such classes at back ground
such  classes   reducess the  generation of . class files
improves the readability
reduces lots  of codes
Syntax

Classname   obj=new ClassName()   //   obj  is  reference of anonymous inner class
{  
    body;

};  // ends

create  an  interface   
interface   i10
{
    void k();   
 int  s=100;
}
 implement  above  interface  using Anonymous inner  class

packages and access specifier

mode of  access         private           default           protected                 public

within a class            Y		    Y	                Y                       Y	


within package            N                 Y                   Y                       Y
 sub class


within package           N                  Y			Y			Y
non  sub class


out of package           N		    N			Y			Y
 sub class


out of package		 N	            N			N			Y
non sub class


    Packages
these are the collection of  classes  sub packages and interfaces
these are  the containers  for  classes  and interfaces
partitioning of class name  spaces into managable  chunks are called packages

advantages
provides  access protection
eliminates  naming collission

types  of  Packages
2 types 
1) built in        java.util java.lang  java.io  java.awt java.net java.sql java.applet
2) user defined   

when   developer  creates  own package  it is called  User defined  package
it can  be achieved  by using
package  packagename;
It  must be a First statement  in program

then  you can write  import  statements and  classes/interfaces


how to execuete  package program  from command  prompt?

  compilation

javac    -d   .    filename.java
-d   tells  where  to store   class file
. tell   class file  must  be stored in  current dir
java  packagename.filename

how to access  one package  program  from another  package  program?
1)   importing whole pacakge(*)
it imports  all classes and  interfaces  of that  package

it increases compile time
Syntax
import java.util.*
2) importing   pacakgename with class or interface name
it imports    corrosponding class/ interface name
syntax
import  java.util.Scanner   
java.util.LinkedList
3)  with out import statement
it uses  full qulalified  class/ interface  name
Syntax
java.util.Date  d=new java.util.Date();



SUB PACKAGES

when u write  one package  within another  package  it is called  sub  package

syntax
pkg1.pkg2.pkg3.pkg4....

in this  pk1 contains  pkg2
pkg2 contains  pkg3
pkg3 contains  pkg4


create  class called  person with  private   fields  id name and age
and  initialize  the  valuses  and  access  and  display  in another  class  called

PersonProgram   through main  method


create   pkg called noida   with     class name Simple
which  contains   static  block , protected void method,
public method  which returns  String and  public static  contant

create   pkg called    up  with  class name   SimpleMain
which contains  main method and   create  object  of  Simple class
and access members of Simple  class

 
java built  in packages
java.lang.*

it is  a  default   pacakge  automatically   imported in the program
no need  to import   by developer
it contains  many classes  
Object
String
StringBuffer
StringBuilder
Exception
Thread
System
Runtime

Wrapper classes  like Integer Double  Character  ......

and  interfaces

Runnable  Cloneable  Comparable

java.util.*
java.io.*
java.sql.*

String class
it is  a   class
it is  sequence  of IMMUTABLE (not aterable)  characters

String is  a final  class  it  cannot be sub classed

class  Abc  extends   String  // error
{
}

how to create  A string in java
2  ways
1) using  String  contructor  (new key word)

String class provides following contructors
String()
String(String s)
String(byte[] b)
String(char[] c)

when  you create  String using new key  word  it stores it's value
in the  heap area
Eg
String s=new String("welcome");
String s1=new String("welcome");
in the  above code 2  welcome's  are  created


2)  using  literal  technique

String s="welcome";
String s1="welcome";

in  the above  code  ONLY 1 welcome  is created
here   welcome  is stored in  String Constant pool  (memory area in heap area)

why Strings are  IMMUTABLE
suppose 5 reference  variables  refers  to same  String Object
If any any ref  varible  changes that  value
it effects all other reference variables also  
That is way Strings are IMMUTABLE

create  a  String using   following  characters
b a n g a l o r e


methods  of String class
boolean  equals(String s)
compares  values  of  2 Strings
boolean ==    compares  references  of 2 String
boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String s)
int compareTo(String  s)
compares the  values of the 2 Strings and returns integer
if  2   Strings are  equals  it returns 0
if  1st String > 2nd String it returns +ve
else returns -ve

int compareToIgnoreCase(String s)
char  charAt(int i)
extracts  1 character at a time
int length()
void  getChars(int start, int end, char[] buff, int arrayindex)
extracts more  than 1 character of a String
String intern()
creates the duplicate copy of the String
int indexOf(String s)
returns the  index  of first occurance of String
int lastIndexOf(String s)
returns the  index  of last occurance of String
String substring(int index)
returns  sub string
byte[]  getBytes()
static  String valueOf(int|byte|double|StringBuffer  )
converts any type to String
String[] split(String regexpression)
saperates  parts  of String
boolean startsWith(String s)
boolean  endsWith(String s)
String   trim()
String concat(String s)
+
char[] toCharArray()
converts  to characters
String toUpperCase()
String toLowerCase()
String replace(char c1,char c2)


extract  day  from above string using getChars() method





2) using  literal  technique


w.a.p to  read  the  sentence and   count  no  vowels(small letters)  using switch  case


HOW TO CONVERT   class  data(Object ) to String?


to convert  Object  into  String   java's  Object class provides
follwing method
pubic String toString()


You need  to override   this  method   in your  program


write   a  program   check entered String is pallindrome  or not
use  String class Libraries
java  program  to find the max & min occuring character in the  String
java  program  to find theduplicate character in the  String
